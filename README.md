# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to discover trends.
1.	Louise’s project purpose was, to filter data from a range of relatable shows that were launched to discover specific trends so she can make a more realistic decision for her play.
2.	I would like to say that I understand the purpose of this challenge. I am more familiar with excel now. I can organize data by filtering and such. I also, know how to insert different charts and much more. The challenge on this challenge for me was, the (countifs). Perhaps I missed that part when the professor was explaining it. I am more of a visual learner. All I need is a perfect example and I’ll do the rest (just show me how to do one similar example). The hint that they gave us on bootcamp was not thorough enough for me.
3.	After looking at the data. I concluded that June is the best possible launch time. If the data shows that outcome would the other margins matter?
4.	My calculations for outcome based on goals are inaccurate. I am sure that there are plenty tables and graphs that we can include in our workbook.
